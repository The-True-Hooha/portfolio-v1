          with different teams as an open-source contributor where I've worked
          on products with monolithic and micro-service based architectures with
          large codebase.

          My main focus these days are building and learning more about scaling
          web technological solutions, design patterns and how I can further
          utilize my creativity and problem-solving skill to help propel
          innovation.
